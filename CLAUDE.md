# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

TreeSitterLibrary is a standalone Kotlin library for calculating code metrics using TreeSitter. It was extracted from CodeCharta's UnifiedParser to be reusable across projects.

**Key Features**:
- **Metrics API**: `TreeSitterMetrics.parse(code, language) -> MetricsResult`
- **Extraction API**: `TreeSitterExtraction.extract(code, language) -> ExtractionResult`
- **Dependencies API**: `TreeSitterDependencies.analyze(code, language) -> DependencyResult`
- Support for 20 languages and frameworks: Java, Kotlin, TypeScript, TSX, JavaScript, Python, Go, PHP, Ruby, Swift, Bash, C#, C++, C, Objective-C, Vue, ABL, Delphi, Rust, Scala
- No external dependencies beyond TreeSitter

**Requirements**: Java >= 17 | Gradle 8.x (wrapper included)

**CodeCharta Compatibility**: This library maintains API compatibility with CodeCharta's metric expectations. Changes to the public API should consider impact on CodeCharta's UnifiedParser.

## Quick Commands

```bash
./gradlew build                          # Build
./gradlew test                           # Run all tests
./gradlew test --tests "JavaMetricsTest" # Run single test class
./gradlew test --tests "*java*"          # Run tests matching pattern
./gradlew ktlintFormat                   # Auto-format code
./gradlew ktlintCheck                    # Check code style
```

## Architecture

Vertical slice + hexagonal architecture:

```
api/                    # Public entry points (thin facade)
integration/            # Feature slices
  ├── metrics/          # Metrics feature (calculators, ports, adapters)
  ├── extraction/       # Extraction feature (extractors, ports, adapters)
  └── dependencies/     # Dependencies feature (extractors, ports, adapters)
languages/              # Language definitions (20 languages and frameworks)
  └── <lang>/           # Per-language: Definition, MetricMapping, ExtractionMapping
shared/
  ├── domain/           # Core types (innermost layer - no dependencies)
  └── infrastructure/   # Tree traversal utilities
```

**Dependency flow** (all arrows point inward): `api/` → `integration/` → `languages/` → `shared/domain/`
